I really enjoy making fun stuff like that but unfortunately, applications need a dedicated server to run 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.\n\n\
**My services will remain free forever and for everyone as long as I can afford server costs**. If you want to help me out and allow everyone to keep using\
this bot and many others in the future, you can visit : <https://www.patreon.com/demonwaves>. You'll get few priviledges in the official Discord server (<https://discord.gg/NRSTQuX>) depending on your contribution.\n\n\
I thank you with all my heart if you do so ! :heart:");
